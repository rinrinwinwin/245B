<!-- Replication reports should all use this template to standardize reporting across projects.  These reports will be public supplementary materials that accompany the summary report(s) of the aggregate results. -->

## Introduction

[No abstract is needed.]  Each replication project will have a straightforward, no frills report of the study and results.  These reports will be publicly available as supplementary material for the aggregate report(s) of the project as a whole.  Also, to maximize project integrity, the intro and methods will be written and critiqued in advance of data collection.  Introductions can be just 1-2 paragraphs clarifying the main idea of the original study, the target finding for replication, and any other essential information.  It will NOT have a literature review -- that is in the original publication. You can write both the introduction and the methods in past tense.  

Racz, Hay, and Pierrehumbert (2020) examines how adults learn to associate linguistic patterns with social cues using an artificial language learning paradigm. Building on previous work, participants were trained to associate different allomorphs with different types of conversation partners, who varied by socially meaningful features such as gender, age, or ethnicity, as well as less socially relevant cues like spatial orientation. The researchers found that learners were better at forming and generalizing these associations when the cues were socially salient—especially gender—suggesting that prior social experience influences which indexical features are more easily learned and applied. The study's intent was not only to replicate earlier findings on gender-based cue learning but also to systematically compare the learnability and generalizability of various social cues in morphophonological learning. This work contributes to understanding how social information shapes early stages of linguistic pattern acquisition.


## Methods

Participants were exposed to an artificial language consisting of two morphological variants (allomorphs), which were probabilistically linked to specific types of conversational partners. These partners were represented by cartoon avatars that varied across different indexical cue dimensions—such as gender, age, ethnicity, and facing direction. Each dimension was manipulated in separate experimental conditions to examine how well learners could form and generalize associations between a cue (e.g., speaker gender) and allomorph usage.

The experiment used a training and testing phase. During training, participants heard and saw the avatar produce one variant of the morphological form and were asked to repeat it, establishing an association. In the subsequent test phase, participants were presented with new avatars within the same cue dimension and were asked to produce the correct form, measuring generalization to novel instances. Accuracy in this phase served as the key dependent variable. This design allowed the researchers to compare how different social and non-social cues impacted learning and generalization of morphophonological patterns.

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

The original study strove to maintain a > 30 sample size throughout all of its trials; in practice, 26-48 subjects were tested in each trial. I performed two power analyses to gauge how many participants would be required to maintain 80% power. I calculated Cohen's d based on the z and b (linear regression) values reported for the variable of interest, gender. 

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result. The analysis conducted based on the b value (b = .79, d = .43) was 83 participants, while the analysis conducted on the z value (z = 2.58, n = 31, d = .477) was 70 participants. This replication study will thus aim to recruit at least 70 participants. 

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
